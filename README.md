# Web Development Project: London Girls' Club ‚ö°Ô∏è

Group Project Completed after an 8-week 'Coding Kickstarter' course run by [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/) on the fundamentals of Web Development (Nov22 - Jan 23). During this project, I covered HTML, CSS, Project Design, Javscript, UX/UI and Accessibility Design before building a final project.

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è About Our Site 
Our website, London Girls' Club, is a community-building space for women and non-binary people who are looking to build a network in the big city.

With the increase in remote-working, people are more isolated than ever when moving to a new city. This especially affects women and non-binary people, who also have to think about their safety in going to events alone or meeting strangers.

Because of this, we built this website as a virtual meeting place as well as a safe and fun place that builds connections through fitness content and classes as well as providing recommendations locally for food, and further afield for travel plans.

The website has three interest categories: Food/Restaurants, Fitness, and Travel. Users can then pick an interest category, for example fitness, and be directed to a page with suggestions of workout classes in London, fitness-related blog posts, and virtual and in-person meet-ups hosted by the company to connect with likeminded individuals in the city. 


## üîÆ Future Scope
While this project was focused on the frontend (particularly styling and design), I have ambitions to add backend and database functionality, increase user interactivity and deploy the website.

This is a front-end application, mainly focused on HTML and CSS, with some functionality and interactivity added with vanilla Javascript.
